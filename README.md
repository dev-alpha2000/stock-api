## Overview

This project is a Stock API app built using React. It allows users to search for stock market information and view real-time data such as stock prices, volume, and performance trends by fetching data from a third-party stock API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, or any other stock market API).

## Features

Search Functionality: Users can search for a stock by its symbol or company name.

Real-time Stock Data: Fetch and display real-time stock prices, volume, and other key information.

Historical Data: Option to view historical stock performance (daily, weekly, monthly).

Responsive Design: The app works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, adjusting to various screen sizes.

Error Handling: Graceful handling of API errors, such as invalid stock symbols or network issues.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-api-app.git
cd stock-api-app

Install the dependencies:

bash code

npm install
Get a free API key from a stock API provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud).

## Usage

Search for a Stock: Use the search bar to enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) or company name.

View Stock Data: The app will display the current stock price, volume, and other relevant data.

Historical Data: (Optional) View historical stock performance with charts for daily, weekly, or monthly trends.

Error Handling: If the API request fails or the stock symbol is invalid, the app will display an error message.

## Example
When you open the app:

A search bar allows you to enter a stock symbol or company name.

Once a valid symbol is entered, the app fetches and displays the stock’s real-time price and additional data.

(Optional) The app can also display charts showing the stock’s historical performance.

## Dependencies

Axios: For making API requests to the stock data provider.
