Overview
This project is a Stock API app built using React. It allows users to search for stock market information and view real-time data such as stock prices, volume, and performance trends by fetching data from a third-party stock API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, or any other stock market API).

Features
Search Functionality: Users can search for a stock by its symbol or company name.
Real-time Stock Data: Fetch and display real-time stock prices, volume, and other key information.
Historical Data: Option to view historical stock performance (daily, weekly, monthly).
Responsive Design: The app works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, adjusting to various screen sizes.
Error Handling: Graceful handling of API errors, such as invalid stock symbols or network issues.
